# yFiles for HTML Demo Sources

This repository contains source code demos that use the commercial [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml) software programming library for the visualization of graphs, diagrams, and networks. The library itself is *not* part of this repository.

# Running the Demos

Most of the demos are hosted [online here](http://live.yworks.com/yfiles-for-html) for everyone to play with. Developers should [evaluate the library](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-html/evaluate), instead. The evaluation version contains most of the demos and the necessary library to execute the code. 

# License

Use of the software hosted in this repository is subject to the license terms of either the corresponding yFiles for HTML license. As an evaluator or licensee of the library you may use the code hosted in this repository for your yFiles for HTML powered applications.
